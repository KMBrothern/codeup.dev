//Ok I want to create a game that checks to see if a word is the same forwards as it is backwards. This is called a palindrome.
var palindrome = 
do{
	var userInput = prompt("Please enter a word, to see if it is a palindrome or not")
	function palindromeChecker(word)
		
}while()
// UNFINISHED
//1. Ask the user to input a string, here I will call it a word in the prompt
//2.check if the string is a palindrome or not(use function here?? Like the age checker example)
	//But how to tell it to recognize the string being === itself forwards and backwards ie; madam
//3. Console.log or alert the user yes or no, it is or is not a palindrome
//4. After you build this checker-- go back and add some flair using previously learned html and css to make it look cooler than a flat white page--Challenge!
