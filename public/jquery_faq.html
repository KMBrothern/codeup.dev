<h1>National Park FAQ's</h1>
    <dl>
        <dt>How many National Parks are there in the U.S.?</dt>
        <dd class="invisible">I have no idea, they don't pay me enough to track that.</dd>
        
        <dt>Do people really get eaten by bears?</dt>
        <dd class="invisible">Most definitely, all of the time.</dd>
        
        <dt>What is the best way to protect myself during my visit?</dt>
        <dd class="invisible">Stay out of the animals 'hood (aka nature) and visit using Google Earth.</dd>
        
        <dt>What can I expect during a visit to a National Park?</dt>
        <dd class="invisible">How should we know, we're not Google. Seriously, that depends mostly on you.</dd>

        <dt>Is photography allowed?</dt>
        <dd class="invisible">Yes, but remember to use caution when in the animals 'hood.</dd>

        <dt>Are there snakes in the parks?</dt>
        <dd class="invisible">Most likely.</dd>

        <dt>Am I allowed to bring home souveniers from the park?</dt>
        <dd class="invisible">Not unless they come from the gift shop. If you steal from Ma Nature she will send her goons for you, and you are probably not about that life.</dd>

        <dt>What is the best season to plan my visit?</dt>
        <dd class="invisible">During human hunting season, the animals are very active then.</dd>

        <dt>How should I pack for my trip?</dt>
        <dd class="invisible">Lightly, in the event, (ahem most likely) you need to run for your life.</dd>

        <dt>Are there any activites to participate in while at the park?
        <dd class="invisible">Think of your own, this isn't the YMCA yo.</dd>
