    <p>Fashion fades, only style remains the same. Doing collections, doing fashion is like a non-stop dialogue. Over the years I have learned that what is important in a dress is the woman who is wearing it. Attention to detail is of utmost importance when you want to look good. I love things that age well - things that don't date, that stand the test of time and that become living examples of the absolute best.
    </p>
    <p>I believe that my clothes can give people a better image of themselves - that it can increase their feelings of confidence and happiness. I don't like trends. They tend to make everybody look the same. I believe that my clothes can give people a better image of themselves - that it can increase their feelings of confidence and happiness. Instead of buying six things, one thing that you really like. Don't keep buying just for the sake of it. Doing collections, doing fashion is like a non-stop dialogue.
    </p>
    <p>When I was young, I lived like an old woman, and when I got old, I had to live like a young person. I get ideas about what's essential when packing my suitcase. Beauty is perfect in its imperfections, so you just have to go with the imperfections. Fashion is to please your eye. Shapes and proportions are for your intellect. I would like to be a one-man multinational fashion phenomenon.
    </p>
    <p>Fashion is not something that exists in dresses only. Fashion is in the sky, in the street, fashion has to do with ideas, the way we live, what is happening. I am never satisfied with myself and that is what keeps me going - I have no post-satisfaction. I remember walking the dog one day, I saw a car full of teenage girls, and one of them rolled down the window and yelled, 'Marc Jacobs!' in a French accent. In a meat-eating world, wearing leather for shoes and clothes and even handbags, the discussion of fur is childish. Grunge is a hippied romantic version of punk.
